# Night-On-The-Street
A 5 mins game designed by Shitao Fan, a master student studying Serious Game and Virtual Reality in Glasgow School of Art(GSA), as the semester 1 Interactive Visualisation  Course individual diorama project.  This is the first game he  ever made.  Players explore environment-based narrative through mouse click interactive. This is an experimental attempt on wordless interactive-storytelling.
